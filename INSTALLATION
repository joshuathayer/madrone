The typical

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

will properly install madrone on your system. However, madrone as a 
stand-alone library does not do you much good- you'll probably want to 
install a number of other modules to create a full madrone application.

You may run the madrone-init script in the bin directory to create an 
example madrone project directory structure, which can be tested and 
modified at will.

    cd bin
    madrone-init ~/projects/HelloWorld/

In order for that application to run, you'll need to install the 
following:

    Task::Plack 
    Twiggy
    sstrace

Task::Plack is a bundle which installs the Plack implementation of the 
PSGI framework. Plack exists at http://plackperl.org/ . At that URL, 
they recommend installing Plack using the cpanm script, which automates 
installing complicated modules. 

Use cpan to install cpanm. The install Plack using:

    sudo cpanm Task::Plack

That will take some time, and will install a number of good things 
including AnyEvent.

Twiggy is a web server which implements the PSGI interface.  Install 
Twiggy:

    sudo cpanm Twiggy

sstrace is a Plack "middleware" which gives you nice stacktrace error 
messages when you application dies, and works in asynchronous servers 
like Twiggy. sstrace exists on github at 
http://github.com/joshuathayer/sstrace . Install it:

    git clone git://github.com/joshuathayer/sstrace.git
    cd sstrace; perl Makefile.pl; sudo make install

sstrace wants a few modules from CPAN (Devel::StackTrace, 
Devel::StrackTrace::AsHTML, Devel::StackTrace::WithLexicals), which 
will try to be fetched automatically from CPAN if you don't have them. 

At this point, you should be able to create the skeleton application 
and run it:

    cd bin
    ./madrone-init ~/HelloMadrone
    cd ~/HelloMadrone/bin
    plackup --server Twiggy ./application.psgi

Point your browser to http://localhost:5000/ . You should see "hello 
universe". Edit at will!
