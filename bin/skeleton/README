This is the madrone application "HelloWorld", autogenerated by madrone-init. 

As generated, this should be a runnable application, assuming you have dependent modules installed. cd to bin, and try the following:

    plackup -server Twiggy ./application.psgi

Add pages by creating new templates, in the templates directory. Back those up with code in the mods directory. Tie those pages to URLs by editing the .psgi file in the bin directory.
