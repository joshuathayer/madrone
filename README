madrone - an XHTML-based template framework
===========================================

madrone takes most of its inspiration from Lift, a template framework fo
r the Scala language (http://liftweb.net/).

Madrone uses browser-renderable XHTML files as its templates. "Active" e
lements of pages are wrapped in user-defined XHTML tags. Those tags dire
ctly map to user code- when the page is evaluated, functions are trigger
ed which may influence the subsequent rendering of the template.

Madrone is able to operate using a non-blocking model. Template elements
 which use disk or network IO should be carefully programmed to remain n
on-blocking- judicious use of asynchronous disk, database, and network l
ibraries should make this easy. Using this model, various elements of ma
drone templates are evaluated in parallel and should retain good perform
ance.

EXAMPLE

This "hello world" example uses two files: templates/example.xhtml and m
ods/HelloExample.pm.

The .xhtml file is the template- it's valid XHTML, and will render prope
rly in any browser. You can style the page however you want using includ
ed CSS files, embed images, include javascript. Your browser will do the
 right thing.

The template includes tags outside the w3c XHTML namespace. Any madrone 
template must declare the madrone namespace: tags in the "madrone" names
pace map to methods in the user-defined modules. This example declares t
he <madrone:HelloExample> namespace; the tag <madrone:HelloExample.Hello
> maps to the the function Hello in the HelloExample.pm package.

Additional namespaces may be declared for variable substitution. In this
 example the "helloExample" namespace is declared for that purpose.

templates/example.xhtml:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transition//EN" "http://www
.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:madrone="http://github.com/joshuathayer/madrone"
    xmlns:helloExample="http://github.com/joshuathayer/madrone"
>
<head>
    <title>hello!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static/css/style.css" type="text/css
" />
</head>
<body>
    <madrone:HelloExample.Hello>
    Hello, <helloExample.audience>world</helloExample.audience>!
    </madrone:HelloExample.Hello>
</body>
</html>

mods/HelloExample.pm:
package HelloExample;
sub Hello {
    my ($self, $context, $bindings, $cb) = @_;

    $bindings->{'HelloExample'}->{'audience'} = "universe";

    $context->{nodeseq}->walk_all_nodes($context, $bindings, $cb);
}

After running:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE ... >
...
<html>
<body>
    Hello, universe!
</body>
</html>
